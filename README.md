# _Ping Pong Test_

##### _A quick demonstration of javascript looping, branching, and variables, October 16, 2015_

##### By **_Max Muller_**

## Description

I created this brief website for the fourth code review of my Intro to Programming Class at Epicodus. On clicking the button, you may enter a number. The page will return each number up to that number, except it will replace:
* Any number divisible by 3 with "ping",
* Any number divisble by 5 with "pong",
* And any number divisible by both 3 and 5 with "ping-pong".

## Setup

* Visit [http://maxjmuller.github.io/ping-pong](http://maxjmuller.github.io/ping-pong) and follow the instructions on the page.

## Technologies Used

* HTML
* CSS & Bootstrap
* JavaScript & JQuery
