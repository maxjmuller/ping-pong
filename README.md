# _Ping Pong Test_

<!-- ##### _A simple web page that displays a person's favorite things, October 11, 2015_

#### By **_Max Muller_**

## Description

I created this brief website for the third code review of my Intro to Programming Class at Epicodus. It is a form, implemented in JavaScript and JQuery, that displays a person's favorite things.

## Setup

* Visit [http://maxjmuller.github.io/favorite-things](http://maxjmuller.github.io/favorite-things) and follow the instructions on the page.

## Technologies Used

* HTML
* CSS & Bootstrap
* JavaScript & JQuery
* I used the HTML "input" element's "placeholder" attribute to provide example favorites in the blank form.
* I used Bootstrap's "list-group" class to format the favorites list nicely.
